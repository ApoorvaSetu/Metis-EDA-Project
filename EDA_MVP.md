## Subway Traffic Analysis for "EatHealthy" Supermarket to put their Ads on.

My Client: "EatHealthy" Supermarket (Like Wholefoods), that sell "Affordable" healthy food. They want to advertise their products and want to target neighborhoods with low income and minorities. 

The goal of this project is to look for Boroughs that have low median income, choose the top two Boroughs and find the stations that are most busy.

I started off with analysing the census data and got the following result:

The graph shows that the Bronx and Brooklyn Boroughs have the lowest median income among the other Boroughs. 

I will then, use MTA data to analyse which stations among Bronx and Brooklyn boroughs are the busiest.
